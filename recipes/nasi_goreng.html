        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Nasi goreng is a <strong> delicious Indonesian fried rice dish that's very easy to make with cooked rice</strong>, eggs, kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), chiles, and garlic. This recipe adds chicken, shrimp, and veggies for a very satisfying meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Â½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons kecap manis </li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30 seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin; mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice is heated through and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
